# Status Update — WebSocket Broadcast Server Plan

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Plan:** `/Users/minh/Projects/stock-tracker/plans/260208-2126-websocket-broadcast-server/`

## Summary

Updated plan and phase status fields from "pending" to "complete" for the WebSocket broadcast server implementation. All 3 phases are now marked complete.

## Changes Made

### 1. Phase Files Updated
- **phase-01-connection-manager.md** — Status: `pending` → `complete`
- **phase-02-broadcast-loop.md** — Status: `pending` → `complete`
- **phase-03-tests.md** — Status: `pending` → `complete`

### 2. Plan Metadata
- **plan.md** — Already has status: ✅ complete in frontmatter
  - Phase table verified all phases show ✅ complete

### 3. Main Project Plan
- **260206-1418-vn-stock-tracker-revised/plan.md**
  - Phase 4: Status updated from `pending` → `in_progress`
  - Rationale: WebSocket broadcast server (subtask of Phase 4) is complete, but full Phase 4 may include additional REST API work

## Impact

- WebSocket broadcast server feature is now fully documented as complete
- Main project roadmap reflects WebSocket work completion
- Phase 4 (Backend WS Server + REST API) marked as in-progress to acknowledge partial completion

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/minh/Projects/stock-tracker/plans/260208-2126-websocket-broadcast-server/phase-01-connection-manager.md`
2. `/Users/minh/Projects/stock-tracker/plans/260208-2126-websocket-broadcast-server/phase-02-broadcast-loop.md`

All changes are minimal and focused on status field updates only.
